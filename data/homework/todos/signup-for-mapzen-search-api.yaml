  While we can use the Google Maps Geocoding API to do geocoding, the Mapzen Search service gives pretty good results with a lot fewer restrictions.

  Here's [the landing page](https://mapzen.com/projects/search/).

  The rate limit is very generous:

  > Search early & search often. With Mapzen Search, you get up to 30,000 geocoding requests per day (and 6 per second) to do with as you wish.

  And this is where you sign in:

  After completing the process, you should find yourself at this page:

  [https://mapzen.com/developers](https://mapzen.com/developers)

  With a search key that looks something like:

      search-BLAHBLAH
