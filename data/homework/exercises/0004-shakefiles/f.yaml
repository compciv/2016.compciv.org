title: Print the final 5 lines of Romeo and Juliet
points: 1.0
description: |

  Open the file at `tempdata/tragedies/romeoandjuliet` and read and print the __final 5 lines__.

  This seems like the same exercise as `d.py` -- except that we read from _Romeo and Juliet_ instead of _Hamlet_. And that we read the _final_ 5 lines instead of the _first_ 5 lines.

  That first difference is easy to do; that second one is a much different problem to tackle.

  [This tutorial walks through the process.](/practicum/shakefiles/f-print-final-5-romeo-juliet-lines)

  Pay special attention to the expected output, particularly:

  - There is no space between the line number and the colon, e.g. `2:` _not_ `2 :`
  - The last line ends at __4766__. Make sure you're not off-by-one.

  Having trouble with adding a number to a string, i.e. `1` and `":"` to make `"1:"`? [Try using the `str()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) to convert a number to a string.

expectations:
  output: |
    4762: Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
    4763: For never was a story of more woe
    4764: Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
    4765:
    4766: [Exeunt]

takeaways:
  - The `range()` function is an easy way to generate a list of numbers to loop through.
  - |
    Combining strings and other data values in order to generate a pre-defined format of string is common situation and extremely annoying if all you know is how to add strings together via the `+` operator. Stay on the lookout [for other methods, as compliciated as they first seem](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string-formatting).
