  Like downloading files, unzipping files is more complicated when you do it programmatically. The zip file might not unpack its contents where you thought it would...

takeaways:
  - |
    You might have assumed that unzipping `tempdata/matty.shakespeare.tar.gz` would unpack the contents of the zip file into `tempdata`. But when you execute this particular program (i.e. `c.py`), you are _outside_ the `tempdata` directory. Unless you tell it otherwise, Python assumes you want things done relative to where you executed the script.

    We've been keeping things simple but it is very easy to not know where "you" are when you executed a script.
