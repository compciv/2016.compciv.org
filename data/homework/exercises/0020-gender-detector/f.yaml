   Print the number of babies per name, for every five years since 1950.

   Just like exercise e.py, except in a for-loop. It's probably not exactly as easy as just copying and pasting the answer from e.py into this one, but it's almost that...

   The answer is a little different too: divide the total number of babies by the number of names, to get a baby per name ratio.


   Also, note that instead of looking at every year, we're actually looking at every __5__ years. This is how you can use `range()` to accommodate that:

   ~~~
   START_YEAR = 1950
   END_YEAR = 2015

   for year in range(START_YEAR, END_YEAR, 5):
       # etc. etc.
   ~~~

               1950
               Total: 378 babies per name
                   M: 427 babies per name
                   F: 280 babies per name
               1955
               Total: 401 babies per name
                   M: 469 babies per name
                   F: 291 babies per name


        tail:
            text: |
               2005
               Total: 127 babies per name
                   M: 149 babies per name
                   F: 96 babies per name
               2010
               Total: 117 babies per name
                   M: 134 babies per name
                   F: 90 babies per name


takeaways:
   - It seems that the variety of names has vastly expanded since 1950, for both boys and girls.

  Here's one way to print the number of babies per name ratio at the end, the total followed by the breakdown for both genders (this comes at the end, so come up with your own variables):

  ~~~py
  print("Total:", round(total_babycount / total_namecount), 'babies per name')
  # for boys and girls separately
  for gd in ['M', 'F']:
      babyct = 0
      namect = 0
      for v in names_dict.values():
          if v[gd] > 0:
              babyct += v[gd]
              namect += 1
      print("    %s:" % gd, round(babyct / namect), 'babies per name')
  ~~~
