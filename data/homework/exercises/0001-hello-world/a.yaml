title: Print "hello world"
description: |
  The easiest and most ubiquitous and most important program in computer science.
points: 1
expectations:
  output: "hello world"
takeaways:
  - You know how to call the Python interpreter from your system's shell/command-line.
  - "You know how to execute a function: in this case, the `print()` function."
  - |
    You're acquainted with the concept of __string literals__ -- not all text is meant to be translated into a computer command. Quotation marks _delimit_ text that is meant for humans, e.g. `"hello world"` -- and text that is meant to be directly interpreted by the computer (e.g. `print()`)

    You know how to print text to screen. If you're new to programming, word of warning: unlike consumer software, your programs do not by default talk to you or let you know what's going on (at least, not until it's too late).
  - You know how to tell the Python interpeter to read a text file and turn it into commands that control your computer. This is an often overlooked but incredible first step.
