      For each year since 1950, count and print the number of unique names by sexes
points: 0.5


description: |
  Print both the count of unique names per gender, but also the female to male ratio.

  As in c.py, only read files that correspond to the year 1950 and afterwards.

  The output should be seen for _every year_, not just one big lump sum as in c.py.

  If this sounds almost exactly like c.py, that's intentional. Basically, just shift where the print statements take place -- if you want them to print for every year, well, they have to be inside that for-loop.

  In fact, every print statement should be in a for-loop.

hints: |
  The `tally` object, i.e. the dictionary of sets, can be used just as it was in c.py:

  ~~~py
  tally = {'M': set(), 'F': set()}
  ~~~

  But just like the print statements, the object must be initialized with each iteration of the for-loop, i.e. with every new year file.
