title: "Sorting those Baby Names (DRAFT)"
description: |
  Read (again) and sort a file of comma-delimited baby name records from the Social Security Administration.
summary: |
    This exercise set uses the same dataset as __0012-get-babynames-2014__, but focuses on a different aspect of lists and sequences: how to sort them.

    DRAFT TK: The exercises and answers are here, but not the hints and walkthrough, which will be added soon.

      Even though the list object has its own `sort()` method, I will heavily implore you to ignore it and instead, use the `sorted()` function, which sorts a list without mutating it.

      This tutorial describes several ways to sort sequences in Python. I highly recommend on just focusing on the `sorted()` examples.

## Learning to sort with sorted()

In the first few exercises, we don't have to know how to sort the lists of lines in order to count and aggregate them. However we will be doing a _lot_ of sorting in subsequent exercises.

In the lesson on lists and mutability, I recommended _not_ using the list method's method, `sort()`. I'll write a short brief on using the built-in `sorted()` function instead.
