title: "Print the 10 most popular names in 2014, regardless of gender"
description: |
  The Social Security Administration's baby name data is ordered by gender,  then by baby count in descending order. Rearrange the list so that it is just sorted by baby count in descending order. Then print the first 10 rows.

    The easiest way to approach this (and the other exercises) is to iterate through each line in the file and create a list. __Then__, do the sorting:

    ~~~py
    records_list = []
    f = open(yourfilename, 'r')
    for line in f:
        name, sex, babies = line.strip().split(',')
        row = [name, sex, int(babies)]
        records_list.append(row)
    ~~~

    Another way to approach this, if you've forgotten how a for-loop can iterate through a file object:

    ~~~py
    records_list = []
    lines = open(yourfilename, 'r').readlines()
    for line in lines:
        name, sex, babies = line.strip().split(',')
        row = [name, sex, int(babies)]
        records_list.append(row)
    ~~~

    What does that for-loop do? Well, `records_list` now contains a list of lists, as opposed to just a list of strings.

    In other words, the above for-loop turned each line (a string):

    `"Emma,F,20799"`

    Into a __list__ object, containing 3 objects:

    `["Emma", "F", 20799]`


    Now, we just need to:

    - Sort babylist in reverse order of its third element, e.g. the baby count.
    - Then loop through just the first 10 elements, and print the results.
