title: Print the number of characters in the Gettysburg Address
description: |
  You're well acquainted with the `print()` function by now. Let's throw in the `len()` function, which similarly takes in a literal string as an _argument_ and _returns_ its number of characters:

  ~~~
  >>> len("Hey")
  3
  ~~~

  Note: there is a difference between a function _returning_ a value and _printing_ something to screen. Try saving the above code to a script, executing, and seeing the output. It's not yet time to ditch `print()` just yet...


  Apparently there are more than one version of Abe's famous speech; use the version found at [ourdocuments.gov](http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=36&page=transcript). Copy everything from `"Four score"` to `"perish from the earth."` (including the closing __period__ mark). The text that you copy should also have line breaks/newline characters between the paragraphs.
expectations:
  output: "1308"
  requirements:
    - "The program must call the `len()` function at least once."
points: 0.5
takeaways:
  - Newline characters count as text characters
  - Python strings can be multi-line as long as they are properly delimited by quotation marks. Good thing President Lincoln didn't use such marks in the text.

      It is possible to call a function on the result of another function, e.g.

      ```
      print(len("hello world"))
      ```
