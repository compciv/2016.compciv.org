title: Building your own Gender Detector
description: |
  Create a gender-detector program that makes its judgments by wrangling those plaintext baby name records from the Social Security Administration.

summary: |
    This series of exercises reinforces all the practice we've had with Python data objects, loops, and working with plaintext data formats. It's meant to be more of a review with the answers more-or-less given to you. But at the end of it, you should have a program that can be used to provide a gender analysis of varying quality, though one that you can easily account for yourself.

### The power of automated methods

<% via_reference 'matias-gender-methods' do %>

> Surveys and human coding will never be able to function in real-time or at scale (the Global Media Monitoring project took 5 years to analyze 16,000 media items). To do that, we turn to automated methods. The simplest approach is to use historical birth records to estimate the likely sex of a first name.
