title: "Deserialize the Google Maps geocoder's JSON file and read its status code"
description: |

  The Google Geocoding API, along with a set of results, returns metadata, including a top-level `status` object, so that the requesting program has an easy way to check if the API was able to fulfill the request.

  For this exercise, simply print out the _value_ that the `status` key points to.


hints: |

  This is a situation in which you can just look at the actual file and find the corresponding object/key-value pair. But please try to do this _programatically_.

  Here's some sample code to open and read the file, and then deserialize it into a Python dictionary:

  ~~~
  import json
  f = open(MYFILENAME, 'r')
  txt = f.read()
  f.close()

  mydict = json.loads(txt)
  ~~~

  Now you just have to print its status key.
