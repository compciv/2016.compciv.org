title: Download and count the number of Twitter accounts operated by Congressmembers
description: |

    - Make a tempdata subdirectory inside this working directory.
    - Download the [JSON file of Twitter profiles](http://stash.compciv.org/congress-twitter/2016-01/congress-twitter-profiles.json) (this may take awhile)
    - Count the lines and print the number.

    The file can be found here:

    [http://stash.compciv.org/congress-twitter/2016-01/congress-twitter-profiles.json](http://stash.compciv.org/congress-twitter/2016-01/congress-twitter-profiles.json)


points: 0.5
expectations:
    output: There are 83556 lines in tempdata/congress-twitter-profiles.json
takeaways:
  - Note that the number of lines in the file do _not_ correspond to number of Twitter accounts.
