title: Download the zip file of Shakespearean texts to the tempdata directory
points: 0.5
description: |
  Write the Python commands to download the file from the following URL:

  `http://stash.compciv.org/scrapespeare/matty.shakespeare.tar.gz`

  And save it to:

  `tempdata/matty.shakespeare.tar.gz`

  You don't need to unzip it, just worry about downloading it and saving it to disk.

  output: |
    Downloading: http://stash.compciv.org/scrapespeare/matty.shakespeare.tar.gz
    Writing file: tempdata/matty.shakespeare.tar.gz
  effects:
    remotes:
      - "http://stash.compciv.org/scrapespeare/matty.shakespeare.tar.gz"
    created_paths:
      - tempdata/matty.shakespeare.tar.gz


takeaways:
  - "Downloading a file, then saving it to disk, is significantly more complicated than it is through the browser."

    This program is idempotent. If the file has already been downloaded, it will just be re-downloaded. Sometimes, that's a good thing. Later on, for truly massive files that just never change, we will probably introduce a conditional statement so that our programs download files only when needed.
