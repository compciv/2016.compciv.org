title: Print a string literal that itself contains quotation marks
description: |
  Inevitably, sometimes what we want to print contains quotation marks. Write a program that prints this on a single line:

  ~~~
  Bob says, "Hello!"
  ~~~

  Remember that single-quotes can be used to delimit a string literal. Try it out in ipython:

  ~~~
  >>> print('he says to "go already"')
  he says to "go already"
  ~~~


points: 0.5
expectations:
  output: 'Bob says, "Hello!"'
takeaways:
  - Either single- or double-quotes can be used to delimit a string. Just be consistent.
