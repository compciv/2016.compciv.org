title: Print the verbose address of every result from in the Google Maps geocoder JSON file
description: |
  For every result in the Google Maps geocoder JSON file, print the text composed of the `long_name` form of each of the result's `address_components`, delimited by a semicolon and a space.
points: 0.5

  This is similar to the previous exercise, except that extracting the `long_name` part of each of the `address_components` is slightly maddeningly complicated. However, if you take some time to think over the details, you might notice how having each address component be its own dictionary, with not just a `long_name` key-value pair, might be very useful when trying to determine if a given result has certain geopolitical boundaries.
