   Count the number of unique names and sum the baby counts and print them for every five years since 1950.

   Just like exercise e.py, except in a for-loop. It's probably not exactly as easy as just copying and pasting the answer from e.py into this one, but it's almost that...

   Also, note that instead of looking at every year, we're actually looking at every __5__ years. This is how you can use `range()` to accommodate that:

   ~~~
   START_YEAR = 1950
   END_YEAR = 2015

   for year in range(START_YEAR, END_YEAR, 5):
       # etc. etc.
   ~~~

                   F: 96 babies per name
               2010
               Total: 117 babies per name
                   M: 134 babies per name
                   F: 90 babies per name


takeaways:
   - It seems that the variety of names has vastly expanded since 1950, for both boys and girls.
