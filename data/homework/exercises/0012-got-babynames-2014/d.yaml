title: Print the top 5 popular names for both baby boys and girls in 2014
points: 1.0
description: |
  Print the top 5 names of girls in order of the count of babies named. Then do the same for boys.

hints: |
  Even though we haven't formally learned how to sort a basic Python list, nevermind a _list_ of lists, that won't be required for this exercise.

  By default, the Social Security Administration lists the names in order of gender -- `"F"`, then `"M"`, and _then_ by their respective count, in descending order.

  This means that the first 5 lines of the file happen to be the first 5 baby girl names with the most babies named. This also means when we iterate through all of the girl names, the first 5 baby boy names will be the 5 most popular baby boy names. So we can do this using an if-statement or two.

  However, if you want to do it the _proper_ way, you can check out the Python documentation for the [built-in sorted function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted), including this [how-to guide](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sortinghowto). In later exercises, this is how we will be sorting our sequences.
