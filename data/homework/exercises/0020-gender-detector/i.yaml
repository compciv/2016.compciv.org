    Print a breakdown of popular names in 2014 by gender ambiguity.



description: |

    This exercise depends on you having created `tempdata/wrangled2014.csv` previously.

    For each of the following gender ratio breakpoints:

    - 60%
    - 70%
    - 80%
    - 90%
    - 99%

    Print the number and percentage of popular baby names (names given to at least 100 _total_ babies in 2014) that have a gender ratio less than or equal to the given break point.

    For example, for the breakpoint of 70%, find and count all baby names in which the __ratio__ is 70% or less toward one gender or another.

hints: |
  All of the code from h.py that is used to deserialize the data into a list of dictionaries can be reused here.

  You have one additional data processing step: filtering that list to include only names that have 100 or more total babies. You should be able to figure this out:


          bigdatarows = []
          for row in datarows:
              if SOMETHINGSOMETHING
                    bigdatarows.append(row)

  The number of "popular" names in 2014 is simply `len(bigdatarows)`

  As for what you need to print out, the process is about the same as it was in the previous exercise. But you start off with a for-loop:

          print("Popular names with a gender ratio bias of less than or equal to:")
          for genderratio in (60, 70, 80, 90, 99):

    output: |
      Popular names in 2014 with gender ratio less than or equal to:
        60%: 64/3495
        70%: 139/3495
        80%: 214/3495
        90%: 381/3495
        99%: 953/3495

takeaways:
  - |
    There don't seem to be many names that fall in what we might have assumed to be "ambiguous". In fact, only 953 names out of 3,495 -- less than a third -- of the popular babynames are at the 99% or below threshold...which means that _more than two-thirds_ of the popular names are essentially _100% for one gender or the other_.
