takeaways:
  - |
    A __filename__ is _not_ an actual file. It's just a __string__ that represents the human-readable name of a file, e.g. `tempdata/tragedies/hamlet`
  - |
    Opening a file, by calling the `open()` function on a filename, does not actually _read_ the file. It just gives us access to a _stream_ object, which has several methods for reading data from the "stream", including all-at-once or line-by-line.
  - |
    By default, the `open()` function will attempt to _read_ a file and will throw an error if that file doesn't exist. This is much, much preferable to the situation when you open an existing file to _write_ to it -- which will immediately wipe out that file.
  - |
    Each line of text in a file has a newline character. That's what makes it separate from the next line. Keeping in mind that a line of text is, well, a string -- you can use its `strip()` method to remove whitespace from both sides of the text, including newlines.
  - |
    It's considered good manners to invoke a file stream's `close()` method when you're done with the file. Imagine a scenario in which other programs are trying to open that file...
