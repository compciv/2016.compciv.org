title: Use variables to refer to data values
description: |
  Variables are human-readable names for labeling data. The Python interpreter doesn't care what actual variable names we use. Just to emphasize that point, pretend you have to finish a program in which a sadistic _human_ has deliberately labeled variables in the most confusing way possible.

  You must use the variable assignments as stated. Use the plus-sign operator to add the text strings together to produce the specified output.
expectations:
  code_preface: |
    hello = "world"
    goodbye = "hello"
    bye = "goodbye"
    world = "and"
  output: "hello world and goodbye"

takeaways:

    Choosing variable names that make sense to you -- not just at the time when you write them -- but when you read them later -- is one of the most overlooked essential skills of the sane programmer.
  - The computer isn't going to protect you from your stupidity when it comes to naming variables.

    Get used to seeing the variable assignment pattern and reflexively knowing what it means:

    - variable name is on the __left__
    - equals sign in the __middle__
    - data value on the __right__

    In other words, you will never see this:

    ```
    "hello" = some_variable
    ```
