points: 1.0

  Game of Thrones is a popular HBO show and book about a "game" this is actually mostly about just one throne. [Actress Emilia Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Clarke) portrays a powerful warrior who has traveled back through time to set her ancient enemies on fire. Her name is "Daenerys" but she will also respond to "Khaleesi".

  In the 2014 baby names dataset, find all records for baby girls in which the given name is:

  - _exactly_ `'Daenerys'`
  - __or__ begins with either `'Khalees'` or `'Khaless'`

  For the latter case, sum the baby count as belonging to `"Khaleesi"`

expectations:
  output: |
    Daenerys: 86
    Khaleesi: 398

hints: |
  Remember that we can check a string for the existence of a substring with the `in` keyword:

  ~~~
  if "hel" in "hello":
       print("hey there")
  ~~~

  If you want to feel especially Pythonic, you can use Python's "unpacking" feature to assign variables the values in a sequence (e.g. a list or tuple) in a slick one-liner:

  ~~~
  name, sex, babies = line.strip().split(',')
  ~~~

  I probably should've formally covered [regular expressions in the lessons by now, as they are exactly the kind of thing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) we want when the text you're looking for has some unpredictable variation. Oh well, in this example, we just have to check for the two variations of `"Khaleesi"`.

  But feel free to use them if you know them. They are absolutely the best thing to use here.
