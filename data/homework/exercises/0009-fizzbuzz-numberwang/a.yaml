title: FizzBuzz Numberwang Edition
description: |

    This exercise is more or less the same thing as the exercise described in the [FizzBuzz Challenge lesson](/guides/python/fundamentals/fizzbuzz-challenge). See if you can do it without copy-pasting directly from that lesson.

    Here are the requirements:

    - Print a list of numbers from 1 to 30, including 30
    - For numbers divisible by 2, print `"Numbe"` instead of the actual number
    - For numbers divisible by 7, print `"rwang" instead of the actual number
    - For numbers divisible by both 2 and 7, print `"Numberwang!"` instead of the actual number


    FYI, [this is Numberwang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjOZtWZ56lc).
