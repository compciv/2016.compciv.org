# Todos for Thursday, January 14, 2015:

Just make sure:

- You have Sublime Text 3 installed
- Your [compciv-2016 repo is connected to Github](/guides/devwork/setting-up-github-and-cli-operations). Or you at least have that repo set up.

You can do the <strong><%=link_to "0001-hello-world exercises", "/assignments/exercise-sets/0001-hello-world-set" %></strong> and submit them to Github.

<!-- On Thursday, I'll hopefully have walkthroughs for this next set of exercises (which won't be due until next Wednesday), among other things: <%=link_to "0004-shakefiles exercises", "/assignments/exercise-sets/0004-shakefiles-set" %>
