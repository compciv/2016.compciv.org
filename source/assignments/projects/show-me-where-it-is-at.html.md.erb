title: Show Me Where It's At
description: |
  Our first project: given a user-specified location, traverse a public dataset with geographic information, and deliver the user to a webpage showing the closest records/incidents.
due_date: 2016-02-09
points: 100
summary: |
  Write a program that shows the user where they are in relation to incidents from a geocoded dataset, using satellite map imagery and other data.

# (STILL BEING DRAFTED)

But maybe you should start thinking of ideas...

# Requirements


## A. Find a geolocated/geolocatable dataset

- Find, collect, curate, and clean a dataset of _at least_ 100 records.
- This dataset must have geocoordinates -- i.e. latitude and longitude -- or address information that can be sent to a geocoding service.

## B. Write a user-facing program

Write a program with these features:

### 1. Geocodes a user's address

- Takes in free-form text input from the user.
- Given an address text string, uses a geocoding service to find the corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates.

### 2. Finds n records in dataset, sorted by proximity to user

- From the dataset collected in the previous requirement, find _n_ records (at least 3) in order of shortest distance to user

### 3. Create a HTML report

Create a webpage and send the user to it (via the [webbrowser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html) module), with these features:

1. Map imagery showing where the user is in relation to the _n_ closest incidents.
2. A table/list of the _n_ closest incidents, with relevant data fields.
3. The webpage can be created locally, i.e. as a text file on the user's hard drive.

__For requirement 2__: For example, if your dataset consists of the last year's worth of [auto theft in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/SFPD-Incidents-from-1-January-2003/tmnf-yvry), besides listing the location and distance from user, your data table should probably also list:

- Date of the incident
- Specific subcategory of auto theft
- Whether a suspect was arrested


The design or aesthetic quality of the webpage is not being graded. But obviously, you should try to make it look nice if you have time.

# Example datasets
 
Examples of public datasets with geospatial data and/or physical addresses:

- [Police shootings via the Fatal Encounters Project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aul9Ys3cd80fdHNuRG5VeWpfbnU4eVdIWTU3Q0xwSEE&usp=sharing)

- [USGS Earthquakes Catalog](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)
- [USGS National Hydrography Dataset](http://nhd.usgs.gov/data.html) - Probably requires a lot of domain knowledge to easily use...

+ [NYC MTA subway stations and bus stop locations](http://web.mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html#data)
- [In-n-Out Burger Locations](http://www.in-n-out.com/locations) - requires web scraping and HTML parsing

### Socrata-powered data portals

You can try [Open Data Network](http://www.opendatanetwork.com/) to do a search across all Socrata sites.

Here are examples of Socrata data portals for various cities and jurisdictions, along with examples of geolocatable datasets:

  + [Disabled Parking](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Disabled-Parking/wc6f-brai) requires a bit of text string cleaning to get latitude/longitude fields
  + [Film Locations in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am) - a fun dataset, but requires geocoding and probably a significant amount of manual data-cleaning and agggregation.
