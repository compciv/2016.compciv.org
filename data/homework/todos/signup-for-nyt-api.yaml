  Using the [New York Times data APIs](http://developer.nytimes.com/) simply requires creating an account on the New York Times site (if you're already a subscriber, you should be good to go):

  [https://myaccount.nytimes.com/register](https://myaccount.nytimes.com/register)

  After signing in at nytimes.com, register a "New Application":

  [http://developer.nytimes.com/apps/register](http://developer.nytimes.com/apps/register)

  And just select all the available APIs.

  This is the typical workflow for working with any API. It's so that the service can track (and limit) your usage.
