title: Count and print the number of non-blank lines for each of Shakespeare's tragedies
points: 1.0
description: |
  You already know how to collect the list of filenames in a single directory. And you know how to read through a file and count the lines. This exercise combines both problems and adds a few twists:

  - Loop through _all_ of the Shakespeare files (there are 42 of them)
  - When reading the lines, track of how many of the lines are __non-blank__.
  - Print the number of non-blank lines versus total lines in each text.
  - At the end, print the total count of non-blank lines and all lines.


  "Non-blank" for this exercise is defined as: a line that has at least one non-whitespace character. However, it's hard to distinguish a completely empty line, and one that is full of invisible whitespace characters. So use the `strip()` function.
