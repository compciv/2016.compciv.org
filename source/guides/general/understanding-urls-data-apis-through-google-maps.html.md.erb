title: Understanding data and URLs through Google Mapping APIs
---

Online maps are so ubiquitous to how we move around in today's world that it's worth thinking about the Web, URLs, data, and APIs through them.


Clicking this [link takes you to a Google Map centered around Stanford University](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Stanford,+CA/@37.4249366,-122.1878931,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808fbac95ef1decd:0x6bad0d43152c9f52).

And here is that same map as an interactive embed:

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d25348.12014038941!2d-122.18789306388686!3d37.42493655876493!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x808fbac95ef1decd%3A0x6bad0d43152c9f52!2sStanford%2C+CA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1452568243844" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Even if you're a complete novice to how the Web works and have never made a webpage, you can at least appreciate some of the technological nuances that come with Google delivering an interactive map upon request.
