    Browsers do a lot for us, even when it comes to resolving the URLs that we manually type in. Because a web browser is used to visit, well, webpages, a browser usually just fills in `http://` if we omit it -- and this is perfectly fine 99.9% of our casual browser usage. However, the Requests library doesn't provide that convenience, so it's good to get acquainted with the corresponding error message.
